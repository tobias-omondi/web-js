// Node.js is important for web development in three ways:

// you can use it to write server-side software in JavaScript.
// • You can also use it to write software for the command line (think Unix shell, Win-
// dows PowerShell, etc.). Many JavaScript-related tools are based on (and executed
// via) Node.js.
// • Node’s software registry, npm, has become the dominant way of installing tools
// (such as compilers and build tools) and libraries – even for client-side develop-
// ment.
